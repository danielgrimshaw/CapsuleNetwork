# CapsuleNetwork
An implementation of a capsule network

Based off of [Hinton's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829v2.pdf)

## MNIST
At present the MNIST implementation is achieving 99.4% accuracy.
I am working on improving the accuracy of this to the paper's 99.75%, but this may just be minor random variation/luck.

## CIFaR-10
If this works on MNIST, does it adapt to more complex images?
As of yet, no.
